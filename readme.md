Photobooth.JS
=========
[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orangecoding/photobooth.js.svg)](http://travis-ci.com/)

Just one way how one could implement a nice Photobooth app for the web. 

  - Use Chrome
  - Apply a nice effect
  - Smile :) and take a photo

Photobooth.JS has mainly been developed to play around with new stuff like WebRTC, Shaders, Browserify and the File-API. As it grew, I thought it would be a nice example project for others to learn. E.g. how to mock dependencies while testing Browserify modules...

#### Note from 2020:
This project has been created back in 2014. Even though, I've just recently upgraded the dependencies, the tech ued in here is obviously already obselte. (Well most of it). I'll still keep it on github for documentation purposes.

Technology
-----------
##### General
A bunch of 'new' technology has been used within Photobooth.JS:

* [WebRTC] - To communicate with the webcam
* [Browserify] - For managing the dependencies within Javascript
* [Shader] - For generating the effects (much faster!!)
* [HTML 5 Audio] - To make this nice flash sounds if you take a photo
* [Canvas] - To display the actual webcam data
* [HTML 5 - FileAPI] - To save the photos taken by the webcam

##### Frameworks
Photobooth.JS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [jQuery] - :) 
* [Seriously.JS] - A nice Framework for working with the camera + some neat effects that one can apply
* [Browserify] - I've worked with require.JS for too long, it was time for something new. Here it is. And it's great
* [Ion Sound] - Great Sound-Plugin for jQuery with some nice free sounds included
* [Grunt] - What else??
* [Handlebars] - Templating engine
* [Jasmine] - For testing purposes
* [Node.Js] - While developing



Installation
--------------

```sh
git clone https://github.com/orangecoding/photoboothJS.git
cd photoboothjs
npm install
grunt
```
If grunt can't be found, install it (I would recommend to install it globally)

######On Unix based machines, you need to be root to install packages globally
```sh
npm install -g grunt
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
Most important grunt tasks
--------------
####Default
The default task if you just call grunt without any parameter.
- will compile all sources
- will start a webserver that serves Photobooth.JS
- will start a livereload service

####Release
- will run JSLint / Tests
- if these tests are successful, the version number in package.json will be increased
- afterwards grunt does a git tag
- everything will be commited

####Test
- will run JSLint
- will run Jasmine tests
- will start a livereload service to run the tests over and over again
 
####Deploy
- will roughly do the same than the default task but without livereload
